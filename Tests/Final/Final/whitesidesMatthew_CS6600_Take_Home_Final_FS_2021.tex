\begin{enumerate}
  \item Considering the Voting System BLP model. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The BLP model of the system does not currently function according to the Voting Process? The fact that ``TM records v and produces c'' violates the *-Property of the BLP model by allowing the subject \textit{TM} with a security level of \textbf{Medium} to write to the object \textit{c} with a security level of \textbf{Low}. \\
      
      To show this we can define our formal model as follows:

      $S = \{V, TM, E, M\}, O = \{b, c, v\}, P = \{r, w\}, C = \{High, Medium, Low\}, K = \{ALL\}$\\
      $f_c(S) \in \{(Low \{ALL\}), (Medium \{ALL\}), (High \{ALL\}) \}$\\
      $f_o(O) \in \{(Low \{ALL\}), (Medium \{ALL\}), (High \{ALL\}) \}$\\

      Now we can suppose:

      $b_1=\{(TM, c, w)\}$\\
      $f_c,1(TM) = \{(Medium \{ALL\})$\\
      $f_o,1(c) = \{(Low \{ALL\})$\\
      $V_0 = (b_1,m_1,f_1) \in V$


      \item Is either system secure from an attack where another voter V' can determine the vote that V made?
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Consider a NI/NF/ND/MSDND model where each domain is labeled as above, but are not hierarchical. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Show, formally, that TMHs behavior is MSDND (or ND) to E.
      \item Show, formally, that V's behavior is MSDND (or ND) to E. 
      \item Show, formally, that TM's behavior is:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item MSDND (or ND) to V.
        \item Not NI from TM to V.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Show how a Clark-Wilson style IVP implemented in the monitor can mitigate the MSDND portion of 2a, above.  Does your solution violate the MSDND portion of 2b, above?
\end{enumerate}
